# Day_7-DictIntro
Dictionaries-for-vehicles
In this file. I have created a dictonary containing keys and values for several random vehicles.
Printed out vehicles using indexing and get method

#Dictonary is a collection of values, that are stored using a key.
#Every value stored in a dictonary has a key and we use the key to get the values from the dictonary

Day_8 - Iterating over a dictionary:
If you are iterating over a dictionary that implies you are iterating over keys. And you have to use indexing to get the values.
