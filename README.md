# Day_7-DictIntro
Dictionaries-for-vehicles
In this file. I have created a dictonary containing keys and values for several random vehicles.
Printed out vehicles using indexing and get method

#Dictonary is a collection of values, that are stored using a key.
#Every value stored in a dictonary has a key and we use the key to get the values from the dictonary
